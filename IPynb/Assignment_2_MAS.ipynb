    "**First**: You will use data from before 2002 in the [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics) to create a metric for picking baseball players using linear regression.  This database contains the \"complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2013, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more\".

    "\n",
    "**Second**: You will use the famous [iris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) data set to perform a $k$-neareast neighbor classification using cross validation.  While it was introduced in 1936, it is still [one of the most popular](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) example data sets in the machine learning community. Wikipedia describes the data set as follows: \"The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.\" Here is an illustration what the four features measure:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Third**: You will investigate the influence of higher dimensional spaces on the classification using another standard data set in machine learning called the The [digits data set](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html).   Each digit is represented by an 8x8 pixel image patch. In addition, the gray values are restricted to 16 different values (4 bit). \n",

The function is called grid search, because if you have to optimize more than one parameter, it is common practice to define a range of possible values for each parameter. An exhaustive search then runs over the complete grid defined by all the possible parameter combinations. This can get very computation heavy, but luckily our KNN classifier only requires tuning of a single parameter for this problem set. "
